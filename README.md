# CodeScribe

CodeScribe is an automated tool that generates beginner-friendly, professional multiline comments to accompany code without making any changes to the code itself. It simplifies the process of documenting code by providing descriptive comments based on the code's functionality.

## Features

- Supports various programming languages.
- Beginner-friendly and professional comment generation.
- Does not modify the code files.

## Getting Started
